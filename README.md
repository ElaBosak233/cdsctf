The **Cloudsdale** project is an _open-source, light-weight, Jeopardy-style's_ CTF platform.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the project! Without you, Cloudsdale would not be what it is today.

The current version of Cloudsdale, while ensuring the originality of the code, largely draws inspiration from [GZ::CTF](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker/GZCTF) in its frontend design. Therefore, I express my highest respect to [GZTimeWalker](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker), the author of GZ::CTF. At the same time, I also thank GZTime for his suggestions on Cloudsdale.
