# Cloudsdale

The **Cloudsdale** project is an *open-source, light-weight, Jeopardy-style's* CTF platform.

You can read more in the [Documentation](https://docs.ctf.e23.dev).

## Special Thanks

The current version of Cloudsdale, while ensuring the originality of the code, largely draws inspiration from [GZ::CTF](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker/GZCTF) in its frontend design. Therefore, I express my highest respect to [GZTimeWalker](https://github.com/GZTimeWalker), the author of GZ::CTF. At the same time, I also thank GZTime for his suggestions on Cloudsdale.
